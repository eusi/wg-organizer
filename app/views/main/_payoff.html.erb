	<p>
		In the past there are many transmissions between the roomies. If someone wants to leave the flat or if a new guy wants to join, you have to do a payoff!
	</p>
	<p>
		In the payoff module it calculates how much money each roomie owe to the shared appartment.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Cut a long story short:</b><br>
		The following table shows the owing debts. If a roomie has a negative amount, he has to pay this value overall to his roomies. If a roomie has a positive amount, he can be happy, because he shall gets this sum from his roommates!
	</p>

	<table width="100%" id="homeTable">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<table class="reference">
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Roomie</th>		
							<th>Amount</th>

					<tbody>
			            <% @payoffbalance.each do |f, k| %>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<%= f.user_name %>

								<td>	
									<%= (k*100).round / 100.0 %> â‚¬

		When you have balanced your payoff, click <%=link_to "HERE", { controller: "main", :action=>"payoff" }, :remote=>true, :onclick => "return confirm('Are you sure? You gonna reset your shared flats account balances permanently!')" %> to reset the account balances of the shared flat. This function will have a security query which all roomies have to confirm that they got the money.
